# Store-Data-Analysis

The "Analyzing Store Data Trends" project is a comprehensive data analysis endeavor that aims to uncover valuable insights and trends within a retail store's dataset using Microsoft Excel. By utilizing a combination of advanced Excel functionalities, statistical techniques, and data visualization, this project provides a deep understanding of the store's performance, customer behavior, and sales patterns. 
The project begins with data preparation, where the raw store data, including sales transactions, inventory levels, and customer information, is cleaned, organized, and formatted to ensure accuracy and consistency. Missing values and outliers are addressed, and relevant data is extracted to set the foundation for further analysis.
